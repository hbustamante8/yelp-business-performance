## Purpose of project

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict a restauant's star rating based on its features it provides. Currently, yelp success is measured through star ratings which ranges from 1 to 5 stars.


## The Data
The data in this project comes from the [Yelp's business, reviews, and users subset data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset?datasetId=10100&language=Python&outputs=null) extracted from Kaggle. 
  * The original raw data contains information across diffierent areas in USA and Canada. For this project, the Yelp business table was best suited for creating a model as it contained information pertaining to what attributes the business had.
  * The data was last updated on February 16, 2021
  * After filtering and cleaning the data, the total records of businesses left were 44,482 with a total of 34 columns that consist of attributes. 
  * Examples of attributes that are included for businesses are
        * Open Monday
        * Restaurant delivery
        * WiFi
        * Alcohol served
        * Noise level
